    <h2>Damien's Pan-Fried Pork Chops Recipe</h2>
    <p>This is a tender pork chop recipe that can be done in 15 minutes.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 boneless pork chops, 3/4-inch thick</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cooking oil</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Do not pat chops dry, so seasonings and flour will stick</li>
        <li><p>Season both sides of pork chops with salt and pepper, then sprinkle with flour</p>
        <p>on both sides. Use the back of a spoon to distribute the flour over the entire surface.</p></li>
        <li><p>Heat oil in a 12-inch non-stick skillet over medium heat until it shimmers.</p>
        <p>Carefully add pork chops and fry until brown, about 4 minutes. Do not</p>
    <p>disturb the chops until they are ready to turn.</p></li>
        <li><p>When you see the edges of the chops turn brown, turn, and pan fry the other</p>
        <p>side until no longer pink on the inside and brown on the outside, an additional 4</p>
    <p>minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F</p>
<p>(63 degrees C). Reduce heat, if they are browning too quickly. Serve warm.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Recipe Tips</h3>
        <ol>
        <li><p>You can season the pork chops the way your family likes them the best.</p>
        <p>Garlic salt, onion salt, or any seasoned salt can be used if desired. For extra</p>
        <p>flavor, add dried herbs to the flour.</p></li>
        
        <li><p>Thicker chops will take longer to cook, and thiner chops will take less time.</p>
        <p>Use a meat thermometer and do not overcook.</p></li>
        <p><strong>Enjoy with your favorite sides.</strong></p>
